dmp.edit.selectedMetaPurposes.help=What purpose should the metadata serve or what is their use? The most frequent purpose of documenting the data generated during your project will probably be to generate "interpretable" data. This refers to providing additional information to ensure the comprehensibility of the data (including study-level information regarding the context of the data collection or variable-level information which is often found in codebooks). "Exchange" refers to information which is used to synchronize the data. This can be useful when data have been collected on separate locations and have to be merged or synchronized based on this information.  "Administration" refers to information used to manage data. This includes versioning and name schemes as well as checksums.

dmp.edit.storagePlaces.help=Regarding digital data, give a reference on policies of the responsible data center or other responsible parties if possible.  Digital copies should not be saved exclusively locally (e.g. local drive on computer) by all means. Because of data protection reasons (BDSG &sect; 40 (2)), personal data, which allow identification of research subjects (e.g. address), and research data has to be stored separately. Regarding storage of analog data, appropriate precautions should be addressed at an early stage (e.g. questionnaires with personal data, appropriate storage of biological samples).
