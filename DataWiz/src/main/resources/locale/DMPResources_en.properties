dmp.edit.selectedMetaPurposes=Purpose of the documentation
dmp.edit.selectedMetaPurposes.help=What purpose should the metadata serve or what is their use? The most frequent purpose of documenting the data generated during your project will probably be to generate "interpretable" data. This refers to providing additional information to ensure the comprehensibility of the data (including study-level information regarding the context of the data collection or variable-level information which is often found in codebooks). "Exchange" refers to information which is used to synchronize the data. This can be useful when data have been collected on separate locations and have to be merged or synchronized based on this information.  "Administration" refers to information used to manage data.

dmp.edit.usedPID=Use of persistent identifiers
dmp.edit.usedPID.help=In contrast to describing the storage location of a file via web address (URL), describing the storage location using a persistent identifier will ensure findability even if the web address changes (e.g. during a restructuring of the data archive’s website). A persistent identifier therefore offers long-term and persistent findability of digital objects on the internet. Thus, using persistent identifiers is required for making data permanently citable and findable. One of the most known persistent identifiers in the field of psychology is the Digital Object Identifier (DOI). DOI are assigned for both journal publications and data publications.
