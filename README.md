# Datawiz

## Code documentation and cleaning still in progress!


DataWiz is an assistant system designed to help researchers to competently prepare and document their data right from the beginning of the research process. The tool assists in creating data management plans and managing oneâ€™s own research data as well as sharing data in teams and later making it available to the scientific community for future use. DataWiz is a free open science web application.
